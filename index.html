        <p>I've lived in Utah my whole life. I've grown to love this place with the beautiful mountains and gorgeous
          lakes. I learned there is so much to do here and have picked up so many hobbies.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="tabs-2">
        <p>Bowling is a hobbie that I picked up when I started working at a bowling alley. I watched people bowl for
          quite some time and picked up the techniques. Soon after I joined a few of my coworkers in a small league. I
          did so good I had someone else pick me up to play their tema one one of the hardest leagues in Utah. I still
          play on that league to this day.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="tabs-3">
        <p>Golfing is one of my high school sports that I still play every year when the weather is right. It's such a
          fun and relaxing game to play with friends. </p>
      </div>
      <div id="tabs-4">
        <p>Riding my Motorcycle is my favorite hobby out of all of them. I get to do it everyday that the weather is
          good. It is a very thrilling way to get from place to place. When I'm not just using it to get from place to
          place I go on rides with my friends. My favorite ride is going up the mountains. There are so many fun turns
          and curves, not to mention how beatiful it is up there.</p>
