            I attended Taylorsville High School from 2013 to 2016 when I graduated. While attending I played for their
            golf and tennis teams. I played golf in the fall, when I started I had never played golf before but soon
            learned and ended playing in our second spot my senior year. Tennis I played in the spring and like golf
            have never really played before. I really enjoyed it though and ended up playing 1st doubles varsity.

            I have been atteneding Salt Lake Community College since I graduated High School in 2016. When I started
            attending I didn't quite know what I wanted to go into so I decided to get my generals out of the way. As I
            was finishing up my generals I took an interest in programming since I was already pretty familiar with
            computer harware. I started taking basic computer programming class when I decide to take a break and attend
            a full-stack web development class at the Univeristy of Utah. After I completed that I returned to Salt Lake
            Community College to finish up my associates degree which is what I am doing now.

            I attended the University of Utah's Coding bootcamp at the beginning of 2019. The Bootcamp was a six month
            intesive course that went over 20+ different languages and really taught me the skills I have today. We went
            over front-end languages, back-end languages, servers, and databases. We learned to use all of these to
            build full stack web applications like this application <a href="http://speakeasydrinks.herokuapp.com/"
              target="_blank">here</a>. Overall this bootcamp has
            taught a lot of useful skills.
